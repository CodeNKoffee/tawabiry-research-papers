# Tawabiry Research Papers


This repository contains the core research papers and theoretical frameworks underpinning **Tawabiry**, a next-generation queue management platform. The documents herein detail the novel integration of classical computer science theories with modern machine learning techniques to solve complex real-world scheduling and prediction problems.

## Repository Contents

### 1. [AI-Driven Dynamic Queue Prediction](docs/AIDrivenQueuePrediction.md)
*   **Domain**: Machine Learning, Queuing Theory, Evolutionary Computation.
*   **Summary**: Presents a "Blackbox" prediction system that achieves 92% accuracy in wait time consistency.
*   **Key Technologies**: 
    *   Finite State Machine (FSM) for state modeling.
    *   Dynamic Erlang-C for baseline estimation.
    *   Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for residual correction.
    *   Genetic Algorithms (GA) for server assignment optimization.

### 2. [Queue Scheduling Methodology](docs/QueueSchedulingMethodology.md)
*   **Domain**: Operating Systems, Scheduling Theory, Human-Computer Interaction.
*   **Summary**: A formal analysis of the **Dynamic Preemptive Priority Scheduling with Grace Period Adjustment (DPPSGPA)** algorithm.
*   **Key Concepts**: 
    *   Adaptation of OS scheduling algorithms (MLFQ, Round Robin) to human queues.
    *   Formal definitions of extensive grace periods and "ghosting" protocols.
    *   Handling of starvation and priority inversion in service environments.

## Research Context

These papers represent the intersection of **Theory of Computation** and **Mass-Scale Infrastructure Engineering**. They move beyond theoretical abstractions to address stochastic behaviors in heterogeneous service environments, validated by commercial deployment data.
